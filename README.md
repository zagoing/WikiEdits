 Sorry that these aren't extremely well commented / organized in a cool and versatile way. VP scraper is the exact code I used to do the VP analysis
 that I posted in the subreddit. The other code is just the component functions that are also in VP scraper. Im a physicist and political data analyst, not a computer scientist lol.
 
 If you have any questions I am happy to answer them, message me or put them in this readme. I'd love to see anything you make with this as well. 
 
 Happy hunting!
